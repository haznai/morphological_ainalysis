# morphological_ainalysis

Combining morphological analysis (Zwicky box) with AI reasoning models to generate new dimensions and discover high-potential combinations for a defined problem (or outcome we want to achieve)

## Key Principles

- **Start from the problem, not solutions**
- **"Bulk then cut"** - Generate extensively in appreciative/generate mode, then evaluative mode prune to killer ideas
- **Test-time inference** enables dynamic exploration with the help of ai reasoning models
- **Consider inversions** (what NOT to do) as part of exploration
